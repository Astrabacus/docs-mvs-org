# Generate address

The steps are the same as Bitcion.

Just specify the length of entropy be `256` bits,  

and specify address version prefix be `0x32` (for mainnet), `0x7F` (for testnet).

## generate random entropy

**random entropy is `32` bytes (`256` bits).**

usually it should be generated by cryptographic securely random method.

```
demo entropy:
"11111111111111111111111111111111"
```

## entropy -> mnemonic

**mnemomic has `24` words**

**mnemonic is very very important!  
Through mnemonic any one can control your account completely.  
So please keep it safely.**

ref. <https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch05.asciidoc#generating-mnemonic-words>

```
mnemonic: 
couple maze era give basic obtain shadow change couple maze era give basic obtain shadow change couple maze era give basic obtain shadow course
```

## mnemonic -> seed

**seed has `64` bytes (`512` bits)**

ref. <https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch05.asciidoc#from-mnemonic-to-seed>

```
root seed (hex encoded):
dfc04ce99cc105a3437bbf37ec5684aa9c657c041dadb375322b24ba6ff227cdb6ccb3ed87d5d8dcfc7f32a1b59a58fc7bdf83ccc6910d06c3f9867b2f0be211
```

## seed -> HD wallet

ref. <https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch05.asciidoc#creating-an-hd-wallet-from-the-seed>

## HD wallet -> private key

**private key has `64` bytes (`256` bits)**

ref. <https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch05.asciidoc#private-child-key-derivation>

```
private key:
83df25fe1d82672767941ae50781682690d45398eb05eedafa3e74cee60c4892
```

## private key -> public key

**public key is always compressed.
so it must begin with `02` or `03`, and followed by `64` bytes**

ref. <https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch04.asciidoc#generating-a-public-key>

```
public key:
030b309ce83d5f53639dc85fb301e3817a1d8845cdb53d74b4051127af2e6890df
```

## public key -> payment address
**address version prefix is `0x32` (for mainnet), `0x7F` (for testnet).  
Address is base58 encoded with this version prefix.**

ref. <https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch04.asciidoc#bitcoin-addresses>

Because of the specified payment address version prefix,  
the mainnet's address must start with `M`,  
the testnet's address must start with `t`.

For multisig address, the payment version is `0x05`, make them must begin with `3`.

```
address:
MPoDhHL8FLnwvyJfiaKHkBR1suUrnM8LXU
```


# Verify address

First install and run a metaverse full node.  
ref. <https://mvs.org/wallet.html> and <https://docs.mvs.org/docs/>

## use `validateaddress`

```
mvs-cli validateaddress MPoDhHL8FLnwvyJfiaKHkBR1suUrnM8LXU
```

## use `importaccount` and `listaddresses`

```
mvs-cli importaccount -n test1 -p passwd1 -i 10 couple maze era give basic obtain shadow change couple maze era give basic obtain shadow change couple maze era give basic obtain shadow course

mvs-cli listaddresses test1 passwd1
```
