## Metaverse Smart Token (MST)

MST is a set of token standards that allow everyone to issue tokens anytime and anywhere, very much like ERC20 tokens. You can operate it via a visual interface without any programming basics. You can even issue a Token in the SPV Light Wallet and these tokens can be safely transferred as Bitcoin.

MST tokens run on the Metaverse(MVS) blockchain (such as MVS.ZGC, CSD, LEBLOCK, etc). MST describes the standard that these tokens conform to. They are all “built” following the same set of “rules”, allowing them to operate on MVS.

1. Globally uniqueness;
2. No need of deployment, user-friendly;
3. Native support for multiple financial instruments;
4. Custom investment thresholds;

The token standardization would necessarily be the most important development direction of the blockchain application. 
Digital asset exchange platforms support several token standards, it will greatly unlock economic energy of the blockchain token and bring about considerable economic efficiency improvement.
