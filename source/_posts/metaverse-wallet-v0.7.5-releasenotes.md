---

Since Beijing time 3.15 11AM ~ 3.16 8PM, MVS mainnet was under `future blocktime attack`, MVS mainnet got separated.
Attacker wrote future blocktime into each block, that caused mining difficulty drop down, then he/she controled MVS mainnet through selfish-mining.
So we decided to hard-fork at height 1030000.

MVS mainnet hard-fork already actived successfully on the safty longest chain.
explorer.mvs.org, lightwallet works well.
Please download wallet v0.7.5 to support this hard-fork to defend potential `future blocktime attack`.
