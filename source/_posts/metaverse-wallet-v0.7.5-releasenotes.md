Since Beijing time 3.15 11PM ~ 3.16 4PM, MVS mainnet are under 'future blocktime attack', MVS mainnet got separated.
Attacker wrote future blocktime into each block, that caused mining difficulty drop down, then he/she control mainnet with selfish-mining.
So we decide to hard-fork on height 1030000.

Now explorer.mvs.org, lightwallet is work well.

Your wallet may be in 2 cases.
## CASE 1 - current height under 1030000
start v0.7.5 wallet, then startup, you will see current height.
Then leave it alone, waiting for a while, see if the height close to explorer.mvs.org

## CASE 2 - current height over 1030000
That means you may in attacker's chain. need re-sync by below tools.
1. Stop mvsd, if running.
```bash
$ pkill -9 mvsd
```

2. Download fix-tool from here, Linux only.
