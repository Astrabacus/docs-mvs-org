Please download the wallet installation package from Metaverseâ€™s official website [https://mvs.org](https://mvs.org). The wallet is now support Linux 64bit system.

There are standard and data packet versions of the installation package. The packet version comes with a database, which greatly reduces the time required for initial block syncing. We recommend that new users download and install this version; existing users are recommended to install the standard version, because the packet version may overwrite some raw data. Please choose the appropriate installation package.

**Take version v0.7.3 as an example.**
