# SuperNova Upgrade Manual

The Metaverse network will be undergoing a planned hard fork at block number 1.27mil (1,270,000), which will likely occur on Monday, June 18, 2018.

What is a hard fork in Metaverse?

A hard fork is a change to the underlying Metaverse protocol, creating new rules to improve the system. The protocol changes are activated at a specific block number. All Metaverse clients need to upgrade, otherwise they will be stuck on an incompatible chain following the old rules.
