## Super Nova Upgrade Manual

The Metaverse network will be undergoing a planned hard fork at block number 1.27mil (1,270,000), which will likely occur on Monday, June 18, 2018.

What is a hard fork in Metaverse?

A hard fork is a change to the underlying Metaverse protocol, creating new rules to improve the system. The protocol changes are activated at a specific block number. All Metaverse clients need to upgrade, otherwise they will be stuck on an incompatible chain following the old rules.

Please follow the following steps to upgrade your client.

**CAUTION: PLEASE BACKUP YOUR ACCOUNTâ€™s MNEMONIC-PHRASE OF MASTER-KEY AT FIRST.**

### Backup
Use cli command `dumpkeyfile` to backup your account information.
```
$ ./mvs-cli dumpkeyfile account_name password last_word path_of_backup_keyfile
```

Then [Reset MVS Wallet](https://docs.mvs.org/docs/reset-mvs.html).
