### Receiving ETP

### Query transaction hashs
Metaverse Wallet provides a portion of the block explorer’s functions. Users can inquire about blocks, transactions or the details of an address through querying the block’s serial number, the transaction hash and the address respectively. Each transaction produces a hash. You may view a transaction’s details via querying its transaction hash.
