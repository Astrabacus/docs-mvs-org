## Why ETP balances are not displayed correctly on my wallet?
1. Please try [online explorer](https://explorer.mvs.org/#!/), [myetpwallet](https://www.myetpwallet.com/), or full node wallet to verify ETP balances.  
2. If you are using a browser wallet, try a different browser and recommend using Google Chrome.
3. If you are using a light wallet, try to create enough addresses so that the light wallet can display `ETP` on those addresses.
